//! Grandfather-father-son (GFS) retention selection (ADR §4.4).
//!
//! `SnapshotPolicy.spec.retention` is the **only** successful-retention driver
//! (SKILL "Retention is GFS-only"). The operator periodically runs this selection
//! over the `Snapshot` CRs for one `(identity, source)` tuple and deletes the CRs
//! that fall outside the kept set; each deleted CR's `deletionPolicy` then governs
//! the snapshot (§4.5). This module is the pure selection kernel — no kube types,
//! no clock — so it's unit-testable with lightweight fakes.
//!
//! ## Algorithm (ADR-0001 §4.4, steps 2–4)
//!
//! 1. Sort candidates by end time, newest first.
//! 2. Apply buckets in order: `keepLatest`, `keepHourly`, `keepDaily`,
//!    `keepWeekly`, `keepMonthly`, `keepAnnual`.
//!    - `keepLatest: N` keeps the N newest backups outright.
//!    - Each time bucket keeps the **most recent** backup within each distinct
//!      period (hour / day / ISO-week / month / year), up to its count `N`,
//!      walking newest→oldest.
//! 3. A backup kept by **any** bucket survives (union). Everything else is deleted.
//!
//! This is deliberately *not* a flat count: a backup that is the newest of its
//! year is held by `keepAnnual` even if hundreds of newer dailies exist — the
//! exact case a flat cap would silently drop (ADR §4.4 "Why not flat-count").
//!
//! ## Empty-policy semantics
//!
//! An all-`None` [`Retention`] selects **no** buckets, so the kept set is empty and
//! every backup is marked for deletion. The caller (controller) is responsible for
//! only invoking GFS when a retention policy is actually configured; this function
//! reports faithfully what the given policy implies. This is documented and tested.
