//! Typed validation errors shared by the admission webhook and the controller.
//!
//! Per ADR-0003 §2.2 (principle 8) and the SKILL "one validator, two callers"
//! rule, cross-field validation lives in [`crate::validate`] as pure functions
//! returning these typed errors. The webhook rejects at admission; the controller
//! calls the same functions defensively before reconcile. The error type is the
//! contract between them, so messages must be **actionable** — they end up in a
//! `kubectl apply` rejection and in controller logs verbatim.
//!
//! ## Accumulation vs. fail-fast
//!
//! Per-field helpers (e.g. [`crate::validate::validate_repository_ref`]) are
//! **fail-fast**: they return the first problem they find as `ValidationResult`.
//! The per-CRD aggregate validators (`validate_backup_config`, …) **accumulate**
//! every independent problem into a `Vec<ValidationError>` so a user fixing one
//! manifest sees all issues at once rather than playing whack-a-mole across
//! re-applies. Both styles share this one error enum.
